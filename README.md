# Hi, this is my custom VS Code configuration.
#### Feel free to copy, modify and say you did it on your own :0

### Installation:
1. Clone repo to `~/vscode-custom` directory
2. Edit `settings.json` and/or `*.code-profile` file[s] - change `<username>` to your local desktop username
3. Either import vscode profile or manually copy settings, keybindings and install extensions from `links.txt`
4. From VS Code console run command: "Enable Custom CSS and JS"
5. *Optional: If VS Code complains about it is corrupted, **CLICK DON'T SHOW AGAIN***
